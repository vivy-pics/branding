This repository contains all of Vivy's branding assets.

## Logos
These logos are the primary branding for Vivy. They change color based on theme (dark themes get white, light themes get
black) but can also be in an accented style. No other form of this icon and wordmark is valid.

### Icon

![](icon.svg)

> Based on the icons that identify AI from the anime Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song. Outer circle is 20 pixels thick, inner
> triangle is 10 pixels thick.

### Wordmark

> Modified Inter Bold.

### Full Logo

![](full.svg)

> A combination of the icon and wordmark, with 20 pixels of padding.

### Accented Logos
These logos are accented (see [colors](#colors)). This should be used for social media avatars or where it's not
appropriate to have a pure white or black logo.

## Colors

Vivy has a very minimalistic color palette, primarily consisting of Tailwind's colors, however it has an accent color of
![](swatch.png) `#60BAD4`. This accent color should be used where white and black is not appropriate for the logo (both
the wordmark and the icon) or as a primary.
